    "## Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Current pretraining objectives in predictive EHR-based models are limited to predicting a fraction of ICD codes within a patient’s visit, when in reality, patients usually have multiple, often highly-correlated diseases. In addition, current models are unable to accurately predict the timeline of correlated diagnoses and could lead to missed opportunities in preventative care. Predictive tasks surrounding healthcare data can be challenging due to the complexity of healthcare data, which includes high-dimensional and often incomplete patient data over time. The state of the art methods used to solve similar healthcare related problems have been transformer based deep learning models trained on extensive datasets and fine-tuned for specific tasks. Despite their success, current models are often fine-tuned to focus on predicting a limited set of outcomes, thus overlooking the interconnected nature of various health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paper Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper presents \"TransformEHR,\" a novel generative encoder-decoder model leveraging transformer architecture, specifically designed for predicting future patient outcomes based on their longitudinal EHRs. The authors utilized techniques like visit-masking and time embedding to achieve results that outperform the other state of the art models. For example, when testing their encoder-decoder model against an encoder only model, the authors were able to achieve an, “improvement of 95%CI: 0.74%–1.16%, p < 0.001 in AUROC across all diseases/outcomes tested.” While the paper boasted strong results on a variety of both common and uncommon diseases, the authors mentioned that their work was related to predictive model studies focused on intentional self-harm. TransformEHR performed exceptionally well within this subspace and esteemed to reduce incremental cost-effective ratio by $109k per quality-adjusted life-years."
